👋 Hi, I’m @darshankocharr
👀 I’m interested in all things DevOps—automation, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.
🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into container orchestration (Kubernetes) and infrastructure as code (Terraform).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on cloud-native development and optimizing DevOps pipelines.DevOps projects or anything involving automation, monitoring, and scaling applications.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect via LinkedIn or drop me an email:-dkochar607@gmail.com!
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m a firm believer that any tedious task can be automated (and I’ll likely build a script for it!).
